      <p class="mid-p">An old-school adventure/FPS developed by Dark Amber Softworks.</p>
      <p class="mid-p">My contributions include part of the soundtrack (as <a href="https://cscd.bandcamp.com" class="mid-link">Cyborg See Cyborg Do</a>), a couple of voiceovers, Russian localization of all in-game text, and social media marketing.</p>
      <p class="mid-p">Book of Adventum is available for PC on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1672610/Book_of_Adventum/" class="mid-link">Steam</a>.</p>

      <img class="boa-img"src="images/dd.png" alt="">
      <p class="mid-p">A small Godot-based adventure/platformer game.</p>
      <p class="mid-p">I joined the team on short notice to help prepare the demo for release. My contributions include coding most of the audio-related logic in the game along with some other interactions (such as level transitions).</p>
      <p class="mid-p">The project has been released on <a href="https://demonicdelight.itch.io/the-demonic-delight" class="mid-link">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="mid-font">WIP: Case Rajamuseo</h2>
      <img class="boa-img"src="images/rajamuseo.png" alt="">
      <p class="mid-p">A Unity-based Android app for Rajamuseo (the Border Guard Museum) in Imatra, Finland.</p>
      <p class="mid-p">The app will allow museum visitors to create their own passport and go on a treasure hunt-like adventure during their tour. I'm tasked with coding various UI interactions along with creating some of the app's sounds.</p>
      <p class="mid-p">The project is a cooperation between Rajamuseo and XAMK (South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences). Read more on the <a href="https://www.xamk.fi/en/research-and-development/utility-game-development-and-game-entrepreneurship-in-the-context-of-working-life-case-rajamuseo/" class="mid-link">XAMK page</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="mid-font">WIP: VR Generative Music App</h2>
      <img class="boa-img"src="images/vr.png" alt="">
      <p class="mid-p">A Unity-based prototype which can generate ambient soundscapes out of given audio files.</p>
      <p class="mid-p">The currently built scene spawns spheres around the listener at randomized time intervals. Each sphere plays a random audio loop (recorded by me) out of a given selection. The spheres go on to move around the listener, resulting in a constantly changing soundtrack. <a href="https://youtu.be/YQ5QY_sWXoM" class="mid-link">Here's a brief screencap</a>.</p>
      <p class="mid-p">The project can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/RostislavGoncharov/-Unity--VR-Generative-Music-App-Prototype" class="mid-link">GitHub page</a>.</p>

      <p class="mid-p">A Godot-based game set in the Book of Adventum universe. Currently in the early stages of production at Dark Amber Softworks.</p>
      <p class="mid-p">The game will combine visual novel elements with Myst-like gameplay. My responsibilities include all coding and some music/sound design for the game.</p>
      <p class="mid-p">Release planned for 2023.</p>
